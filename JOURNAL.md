## 11/1/2025 - First Journal Entry  

This is a project that i have been working on for a bit. It's for me and a friend from school, who has wrist pain and his laptop keyboard is absolutely terrible. The ergogen config was made about a month ago and i haven't worked on it for a while because i was busy but i routed it today on the pcb in kicad and prepared it to be ordered from allpcb.
The setup is reversible and designed to cost about AU$50 (about US$30) per pair of boards -- i haven't made a full BOM yet but that's next i think.
