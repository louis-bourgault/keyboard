## 11/1/2025 2:10 PM - First Journal Entry  

This is a project that i have been working on for a bit. It's for me and a friend from school, who has wrist pain and his laptop keyboard is absolutely terrible. The ergogen config was made about a month ago and i haven't worked on it for a while because i was busy but i routed it today on the pcb in kicad and prepared it to be ordered from allpcb.
The setup is reversible and designed to cost about AU$50 (about US$30) per pair of boards -- i haven't made a full BOM yet but that's next i think.

## 11/1/2025 2:50 PM - Fixed routing traces that showed as unconnected  

kicad was being painful and saying that i hadn't routed things that i was pretty sure i'd routed (since its dual sided and reversible it was registering that one side did not connect properly to the other. Anyway, I just made alternate tracks so that the energy could flow on two different paths just in case, and that made it be quiet. DRC doesn't show any critical warnings any more

## 11/1/2025 3 PM - Exported Gerbers and Ordered PCB  

I saw that allpcb was offering manufacturing and delivery for US $1 so i just impulsively exported my gerbers and ordered some pcbs! They should come in 3 days or so -- I won't have any electrical components by that time to attatch to them, but it will be cool to look at and will help me design my case around them.

## 11/1/2025 9 PM - Created first draft of BOM  

Did some research on sourcing of parts and how expensive everything is going to be, and made a first draft of a BOM in libreoffice. Honestly, less than I thought -- about 80 australian or 55 american dollars for 2 keyboards, fully wireless and split.
I did include welcome deal for the switches, which I am going to make use of, but didn't use any of the aliexpress sales which are on all the time. Hopefully that will bring it down even more

## 11/2/2025 1 PM - Started work on case design  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzY1OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ded5353b05e4267ae4986bcc66c3f10d82ebfa78/image.png)

Working on Fusion 360 design -- looks pretty good so far! Just designed a simple case.
Halfway through I realised that I'd been designing in non parametric mode. Why does fusion even have that? There's nothing that i would need to go back and change though, so i don't think it'll be a problem.  

## 11/2/2025 4 PM - Added plate to the fusion file  

Also exported everything that i've made as stls and put my fusion document into there for the case. Ergogen is actually kind of amazing for this kind of thing -- it let me define a case outline and download it as a dxf, and then i could just chuck it into Fusion and extrude and it's now part of my main design.
All of these new files are on the github repo
getting close to submitting now!

## 11/2/2025 5 PM - Made Initial Firmware  

I set up zmk with my pin layout. Well, with quite a lot of help from Claude. 
Zmk is very complicated, and I don't want to make a full layout until I have the hardware with me ready to play with. So, I just made a basic one for now

## 11/6/2025 - Finalised Bill of Materials  

I found some rather cheap keycaps that I can use! They cost about 20 cents australian each, and I'll get free shipping on my first order so i think that will be OK.
I'm actually pretty proud of how cheaply I'm going to be able to do this. US$70 is pretty good for two keyboards, it seems. A lot of this is, of course, because of welcome deals. 

Also, I said I wouldn't in the last entry, but did some brainstorming on keyboard layouts on paper. I printed off a sheet to fill in and played around with it -- i also gave one to the friend I'm doing it with. I won't put it into the firmware until I've got actual hardware ready to work with, but it's a start

## 11/8/2025 - Redid BOM  

A few things have sold out since I made my bom, which was a bit annoying, but i redid those things. Also, dealing with pricing is painful especially on sites that don't give itemised reports for tax (speaking of which, Australia seems to have rather complicated and hard to account for import taxes on things). Because of this, the BOM does not entirely match the amount in the screenshots, because I couldn't figure out how to itemise these fees with the framework that I had set up.
Anyway, here are the cart screenshots![aliexpress_order](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTM0OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a78ee0e0082862e57d89904b82e03c08033d85a0/aliexpress_order.png)![alibaba_order](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTM0NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0aaed83e65c84963fd7cb4a5f78770c4fed0c133/alibaba_order.png)
