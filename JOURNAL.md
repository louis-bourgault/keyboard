## 11/1/2025 2:10 PM - First Journal Entry  

This is a project that i have been working on for a bit. It's for me and a friend from school, who has wrist pain and his laptop keyboard is absolutely terrible. The ergogen config was made about a month ago and i haven't worked on it for a while because i was busy but i routed it today on the pcb in kicad and prepared it to be ordered from allpcb.
The setup is reversible and designed to cost about AU$50 (about US$30) per pair of boards -- i haven't made a full BOM yet but that's next i think.

## 11/1/2025 2:50 PM - Fixed routing traces that showed as unconnected  

kicad was being painful and saying that i hadn't routed things that i was pretty sure i'd routed (since its dual sided and reversible it was registering that one side did not connect properly to the other. Anyway, I just made alternate tracks so that the energy could flow on two different paths just in case, and that made it be quiet. DRC doesn't show any critical warnings any more

## 11/1/2025 3 PM - Exported Gerbers and Ordered PCB  

I saw that allpcb was offering manufacturing and delivery for US $1 so i just impulsively exported my gerbers and ordered some pcbs! They should come in 3 days or so -- I won't have any electrical components by that time to attatch to them, but it will be cool to look at and will help me design my case around them.

## 11/1/2025 9 PM - Created first draft of BOM  

Did some research on sourcing of parts and how expensive everything is going to be, and made a first draft of a BOM in libreoffice. Honestly, less than I thought -- about 80 australian or 55 american dollars for 2 keyboards, fully wireless and split.
I did include welcome deal for the switches, which I am going to make use of, but didn't use any of the aliexpress sales which are on all the time. Hopefully that will bring it down even more
