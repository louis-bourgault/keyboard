My design for a lily58 inspired split wireless keyboard using ergogen and kicad.
One of my friends has significant wrist pain because his laptop keyboard is terrible. A few months ago we were planning to make a keyboard together and made things in Ergogen but never got that much further than that. Now, I have put things into kicad and done a bit more work in preparing things to be actually manufactured.
This is designed to be pretty much as cheap a keyboard as it is possible to manufacture, aiming for about AU$50 per keyboard (I am making two of these, so more like $100 total). This comes out to about $30 USD per keyboard, $60 total.
